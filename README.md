# Receipt Analysis System

## Overview
The Receipt Analysis System is a specialized tool designed to extract, normalize, and correlate receipt data with an existing product database. It provides structured output with confidence scoring and vendor matching capabilities.

## Key Features
- Automated receipt text extraction
- Merchant name fuzzy matching
- Product normalization and database correlation
- Confidence scoring for extracted information
- Standardized JSON output format

## Core Functionality

### 1. Data Extraction
The system extracts the following fields from receipts:
- Merchant name (with confidence scoring)
- Transaction date and time
- Individual line items and prices
- Total amount
- Tax amount (when available)
- Payment method (when available)

### 2. Database Correlation
The system performs several correlation tasks:
- Fuzzy matching of merchant names against known vendors
- Product name normalization for database matching
- Identification of new products not in the database
- Suggestion of similar vendor matches based on context

### 3. Output Format
The system returns data in a standardized JSON structure:

```json
{
  "merchant": {
    "extracted_name": "",
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "suggested_matches": []
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "raw_text": "",
      "normalized_name": "",
      "price": 0.0,
      "in_database": boolean,
      "similar_products": []
    }
  ],
  "transaction": {
    "date": "",
    "total": 0.0,
    "tax": 0.0,
    "payment_method": ""
  }
}
```

## Technical Specifications
- Temperature Setting: 0.3 (optimized for accuracy)
- Context Window: 4096 tokens
- Base Model: LLama2

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. Ensure receipt images or text are clear and complete
2. Provide as much context as possible for merchant matching
3. Regularly update the product database for better matching
4. Monitor confidence scores for quality assurance

### Error Handling
- The system will always return a complete JSON structure
- Missing fields will be returned as empty strings or 0.0
- Failed matches will return empty arrays for suggestions
- Confidence scores below certain thresholds should trigger manual review

## Integration Notes
- The system is designed for programmatic integration
- Strict JSON output format enables easy parsing
- No additional text or formatting is included in the response
- All fields maintain consistent data types

## Maintenance
- Regular updates to the merchant database recommended
- Periodic review of normalization rules
- Monitoring of unmatched products for database updates
- Calibration of confidence thresholds based on performance

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized for accuracy over speed (temperature 0.3)
- Sufficient context window for most receipts (4096 tokens)
- Fuzzy matching algorithms may impact processing time
- Consider batch processing for large volumes
